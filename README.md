# Beginner Python Projects 🐍

This repository contains some of my early Python projects as I begin my programming journey.

## Projects
1. **Volume of Cylinder** – Calculates the volume based on radius and height.
2. **Volume of Cuboid** – Uses length, width, height.
3. **Hypotenuse Calculator** – Calculates hypotenuse using Pythagorean theorem.
4. **Shopping Cart** – Calculates total cost based on item price and quantity.

All projects are created using basic Python and `input()` functions.
